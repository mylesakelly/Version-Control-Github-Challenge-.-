Medium challenge: The terminal is used to easily navigate your computer. 
When you first open the terminal you will see the user, box and the folder.
From there you can easily navigate to your Desktop using the command cd dir
From the desktop you can creat new folders and files and delete folders and files.
Files can also be edited using the vi file command. 
Other commands such as pwd and ls can help you better navigate your folders on your Desktop.

The difference between Git and Github is that Git lets you
manage and keep track of your source code. As you make changes in your code
Git allows you to go back to your previous versions of your code.
Git-hub on the other hand is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you 
manage your repositories.

We use Github to manage our repositories. Github can also be used
to collaborate with other developers on open-source projects. It can also
be used as a social networking site where developers can network with each other.
